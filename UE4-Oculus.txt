UE4 Oculus
----------
Setup windows with extend desktop onto all displays, no mirroring. Single display is also ok.
When running the game, if it is set for fullscreen (either in config or by pressing F11), and a HMD is detected, it will go into fullscreen on
the HMD only. If you don't want to use fullscreen, the sensor is still used for positioning and stereo/lens distortion compensation can
be enabled manually. The headset must be connected before running the game.  Only one HMD can be connected at a time.
