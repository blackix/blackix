UE4 Oculus
----------
Setup windows with extend desktop onto all displays, no mirroring. Single display is also ok.
When running the game, if it is set for fullscreen (either in config or by pressing F11), and a HMD is detected, it will go into fullscreen on
the HMD only. If you don't want to use fullscreen, the sensor is still used for positioning and stereo/lens distortion compensation can
be enabled manually. The headset must be connected before running the game.  Only one HMD can be connected at a time.

Stereo/HMD Configuration
------------------------
stereo on|off|toggle		Stereo mode on/off
stereo hmd					Turns stereo on and re-direct rendering to the Rift.
hmd enable|disable			Completely disables or re-enables HMD
hmd vsync on|off			Sets VSync on/off for stereo mode (only)
hmd vsync reset				Resets to original r.VSync value.
hmd sp 125					Overrides default screenpercentage for stereo mode.
hmd sp reset				Resets to original r.ScreenPercentage value.
hmd lp [on|off]				Enables/disables/toggles low-persistence mode (DK2 and up only)
hmd timewarp [on|off]		Enables/disables/toggles timewarp mode.
hmd mirror [on|off|toggle]	Enables/disables/toggles mirroring in a window (for "Application Only" mode only).
hmd mirror 800x600			Sets mirror window dimension (for Direct mode only).
hmd overdrive [on|off]		Enables/disables/toggles overdrive of brightness transitions to reduce artifacts on DK2+ displays.
hmd profile					Toggles "profiling mode" that eliminates extra waits in Present with timewarp. Use it if you are profiling the game.
stereo e=0.064				Eye distance (m). Use 'stereo reset' to restore original value.
stereo w2m=100				Overrides default worldunits-to-meters scale. Use 'stereo reset' to restore original value.
stereo ncp=10 fcp=10000		Overrides near clipping and/or far clipping planes for stereo rendering (in cm). Use 'stereo reset' to restore original value.
stereo show					Shows current ipd and head model offset
stereo reset				Resets stereo settings

hmdpos on|off				Enables/disables positional tracking.
hmdpos reset				Resets forward direction and 'zero' position
hmdpos reset -37			Resets forward direction and apply yaw rotation (in degrees) and 'zero' position
hmdpos showcamera [off | toggle] Draws a tracking camera frustum in the game's world.
hmdpos show					Shows status of positional tracking.

Stereo/HMD Internals
--------------------
motion reset                Resets sensor fusion
motion enforce				Toggles motion tracking even if not in stereo (for testing purposes). 

hmdmag on|off				Turns magnetometer on/off
hmdmag show					Shows state of magnetometer

hmdwarp on|off				Distortion on/off (works only when DirectRendering is off)
hmdwarp cha					Turns on chromatic aberration correction
hmdwarp nocha				Turns off chromatic aberration correction
hmdwrap show				Shows current state of hmdwarp

Misc
----
hmd stats					Shows HMD-related stats.
hmd grid					Toggles lens-centered grid.
SetFinishFrame on|off		Wait for last or current frame. By default it is on in stereo mode, off otherwise.
							This will reduce the max framerate you can get, if it was more than the vsync limit,
							but, more importantly, this will reduce the latency. Always ON if timewarp is ON.
hmd updateongt on|off		Turns on/off update-on-gamethread mode (for debugging). On by default.
hmd updateonrt on|off		Turns on/off update-on-renderthread mode for lower latency. On by default.
ovrversion					Prints Oculus SDK version used and Oculus Plugin info
uncapfps 					Uncaps FPS (allows FPS > 62); to restore cap - "set Engine bSmoothFrameRate 1"
