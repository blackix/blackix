CeCILL-C FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

Notice

This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with the two main principles guiding its drafting:

    firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to users,
    secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which it is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to both authors and holders of the economic rights over software.

The authors of the CeCILL-C1 license are:

Commissariat Ã  l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical and industrial research establishment, having its principal place of business at 25 rue Leblanc, immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015 Paris, France.

Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public scientific and technological establishment, having its principal place of business at 3 rue Michel-Ange, 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.

Preamble

The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users the right to modify and re-use the software governed by this license.

The exercising of this right is conditional upon the obligation to make available to the community the modifications made to the source code of the software so as to contribute to its evolution.

In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy, modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or removed herefrom.

This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.

The Licensor disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence of a trademark.

10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance with the terms and conditions hereof.
Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS
11.1 EXCUSABLE EVENTS

Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to perform the Agreement, that may be attributable to an event of force majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as defective functioning or interruptions of the electricity or telecommunications networks, network paralysis following a virus attack, intervention by government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes, fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.

11.3 The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreements, whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as between the Parties unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives.

11.4 In the event that one or more of the provisions hereof were to conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text, said act or legislative text shall prevail, and the Parties shall make the necessary amendments so as to comply with said act or legislative text. All other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, invalidity of a provision of the Agreement, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement as a whole to be invalid.
11.5 LANGUAGE

The Agreement is drafted in both French and English and both versions are deemed authentic.
Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT

12.1 Any person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies of this Agreement.

12.2 So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is protected and may only be modified by the authors of the License, who reserve the right to periodically publish updates or new versions of the Agreement, each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may address new issues encountered by Free Software.

12.3 Any Software distributed under a given version of the Agreement may only be subsequently distributed under the same version of the Agreement or a subsequent version.

2. If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source, then you must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)

 Origin: Clause 1 of the IJG license, Clause 2 of the libjpeg/SIMD license

3. If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source, then you must include the README file from IJG, and you must not alter any of the copyright or license text in that file.

 Origin: Clause 1 of the IJG license

4. If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or if you are distributing an application that statically links with libjpeg-turbo, then your product documentation must include a message stating that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".

 Origin: Clause 2 of the IJG license

5. If your binary-only distribution or statically-linked application includes/uses the TurboJPEG API, then your product documentation must include the text of the libjpeg-turbo license.

 Origin: Clause 2 of the libjpeg-turbo license

6. You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.

 Origin: IJG license, Clause 3 of the libjpeg-turbo license

7. The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant the software to be free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable consequences resulting from your use of the software.

The following software may be included in this product: libjpeg. This software contains the following license and notice below:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions: (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group". (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.

We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."
